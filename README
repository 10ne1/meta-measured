meta-measured
============

This layer's purpose is constructing a linux system that performs a 'measured launch'. This requires enabling support for:
- the TPM and Intel TXT (kernel config / module)
- the TCG Software Stack (through TrouSerS)
- tboot and Authenticated Code Modules (ACMs)

status
------
Dec 29, 2012 - Bootable hddimg with tboot for SugarBay BSP.
Oct 21, 2012 - Initial checkin.


Dependencies
------------

This layer depends on the openembedded metadata and bitbake.

Maintenance
-----------
Please see the MAINTAINERS file for information on contacting the maintainers
of this layer, as well as instructions for submitting patches.


Building the meta-measured layer
-------------------------------
Enable this layer like you enable any other layer.  If you wish to build the
reference images you can clone the 'measured-build-scripts' repo from my github
and use that to set up bitbake and the basic OE metadata for you.
